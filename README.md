### ✅  Data Cleaning Summary
This document outlines the steps taken to clean and prepare the Amazon product review dataset for analysis using Microsoft Excel.
### 🛠️ Cleaning Steps
- **Used Delimiter Tool**:  
  Split combined columns using Excel’s delimiter feature to separate values cleanly (e.g., product names, Category,Review ID)
- **Standardized Text Columns**:  
  - Removed inconsistent spacing and capitalization in columns
  - Ensured consistent formatting for easier grouping and filtering.
### Calculated Columns
Created four new columns to enhance analysis:

   Categorized products into price ranges (e.g., `₹200–500`, `>₹500`) based on `Discounted_price`.
2. **Discount**  
   Classified discount levels (e.g., `High`, `Medium`) based on `Discount_percentage`.
3. **Potential Revenue**  
   Estimated revenue using the formula:  
   `Potential_revenue = Discounted_price × Rating_count`
4. **Rating Score**  
   Weighted product popularity and quality using:  
   `Rating_Score = Rating × Rating_count`
